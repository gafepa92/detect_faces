# Detect_faces
OpenCV face detection

#Q1)
The file opencv-facedetect.ipynb has code to open a video file and detect faces using a pre-trained cascade of classifiers from OpenCV. Your task will be to read and understand the code, and re-write it using C++ to detect faces in a video stream coming from a webcam. You can use the code you developed in earlier homework assignments as a template.
